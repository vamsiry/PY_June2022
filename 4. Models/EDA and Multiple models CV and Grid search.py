#What We notice
#------------------
#Ideally you would want features that correlate with the target column if 
#you are going for linear regression, in that case overallQuall seems to be
# very linearly correlated, which makes sense. however mssubclass is not 
#linearly correlated, which means it is not useful for linear models, 
#we will keep them for now and use recursive feature elimination or 
#pca later, but only after encoding.

#One more thing you need to know is that features that correlate with each 
#other are not that useful, like YearBuilt, and GarageYrBlt since most 
#likely they are going to be the same, we only need one of them, and
# this is visually represented in the correlation matrix.



#%%
# mapping some ordinal features in the correct order
# because the OrdinalEncoder uses alphabitical order which is not meaningful
# you could override the default behaviour of the OrdinalEncoder by passing a list of
# categories in the correct order but then you would need to create an encoder for each feature

#Model selectionÂ¶
#----------------------
#Now since this is a regression problem with many features, and high 
#linear correlation between those features and the target, we can use 
#linear regression.

# We will also try ensemble learning and see if it gives better results.

#In the following cells, you will learn:

#1.How to train a scikit-learn estimator (model)
#2.How to evaluate the model using cross validation

#%%

# scores is an array of five elements each element is the scoring on a certain fold
scores = cross_val_score(model, X_preprocessed, y, scoring="neg_root_mean_squared_error", cv=3)
# we are going to use the mean of these scores as an evaluation metric

#Grid searchÂ¶
#-----------------
#It look like GradientBoostingRegressor gave the best results. Now let's 
#figure out which parameters we should give to this model to get the best results.

# There are two methods:
#1.Grid Search
#2.Random Search In the first you try the model with all possible 
#combinations of given parameters and choose the best one, the latter 
#doesn't look at all combinations, it only look at random samples which
# makes it more effecient but less optimal.

#%%
# Since we don't care that much about time since the model is fairly small,
# we are going to use grid search

from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

## First you need to define the parameter space, or the grid
# it is a simple dictionary where:
# the keys are the names of the parameters given to the estimator
# the values are lists of possible values for each parameter
# the search is going to go as follows
# {"n_estimators": 100, learning_rate: 0.001, max_depth: 3}
# {"n_estimators": 100, learning_rate: 0.001, max_depth: 5}
